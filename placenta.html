<p>&nbsp;<span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:times new roman,times,serif;">The placenta is a unique organ that serves as an interface between a mother and a fetus.&nbsp;The placenta plays an important role in fetal growth and development. Placental vasculature and surrounding&nbsp;tissue support transport of oxygen, glucose and other nutrients from the mother to the fetus. Increasing&nbsp;evidence suggests that modifiable maternal factors, such as obesity, impact placental function and therefore&nbsp;fetal health. This motivates development of technology for in vivo, real time monitoring of placental structure&nbsp;and function.</span></span></p>

<p>Facts about the placenta</p>

<p>Weight: the term placenta typically weighs 1 pound.</p>

<p>Size: the human placentas has average thickness of 2-2.5cm, and diameter of 22cm. It is just about the size of the human face.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Placenta is an interface between mother and fetus. The membrane in the placenta that interface maternal and fetal blood has&nbsp;surface area of about 13 m<sup>2</sup>. That is the size of a parking spot.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The placenta is much more than a passive conduct between the mother and the fetus. It provides nutrition to the baby, and functions as its lungs, kidneys and immune system.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The National Institute of Child&nbsp;Health and Human Development&nbsp;has recently launched the Human Placenta Project. We expect to learn much much more about the placenta and its relationship to fetal and maternal wellbeing as the project goes.&nbsp;&nbsp;https://www.nichd.nih.gov/research/HPP/Pages/default.aspx</p>
