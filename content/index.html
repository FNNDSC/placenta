<p>&nbsp;<span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:times new roman,times,serif;">The placenta is a unique organ that serves as an interface between a mother and a fetus.&nbsp;The placenta plays an important role in fetal growth and development. Placental vasculature and surrounding&nbsp;tissue support transport of oxygen, glucose and other nutrients from the mother to the fetus. Increasing&nbsp;evidence suggests that modifiable maternal factors, such as obesity, impact placental function and therefore&nbsp;fetal health. This motivates development of technology for in vivo, real time monitoring of placental structure&nbsp;and function.</span></span></p>

<p>Facts about the placenta</p>

<p>Weight: the term placenta typically weighs about <b>500g</b> (or about 1 pound).</p>

<p>Size: the human placentas has an average thickness of <b>2.0 to 2.5cm<b>, and diameter of about <b>22cm</b>. It is just about the size of the human face.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Placenta is an interface between mother and fetus. The membrane in the placenta that interface maternal and fetal blood has&nbsp;surface area of about 13 m<sup>2</sup>. That is the size of a parking spot.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The placenta is much more than a passive conduct between the mother and the fetus. It provides nutrition to the baby, and functions as its lungs, kidneys and immune system.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The National Institute of Child&nbsp;Health and Human Development&nbsp;has recently launched the Human Placenta Project. The placenta and its relationship to fetal and maternal wellbeing will be much better understood as&nbsp;the project goes.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nichd.nih.gov/research/HPP/Pages/default.aspx">https://www.nichd.nih.gov/research/HPP/Pages/default.aspx</a></p>

<p class="p1">Motion due to mother breathing, uterus contraction, fetal movements are&nbsp;one of the main challange during fetal and placental MRI. The following movie demonstrates the motion in uterus along time.</p>

<p>Using MRI to visualize the oxygen transport in placenta&nbsp;in realtime, as oxygen supply to the mother was alternated from room air (21% O2)&nbsp;to oxygen (100% O2) and back to room air.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Project: Assessment of twin placentas</p>

<p>Selective intrauterine growth restriction (sIUGR) in monochorionic twins is associated with a substantial increase in perinatal mortality and morbidity for both twins. Assessment of placental insufficiency, primary&nbsp;cause of sIUGR, currently&nbsp;relies on indirect measures of umbilical artery (UA) Doppler. We hope novel MRI methods will improve the prenatal evaluation of placental function.</p>
